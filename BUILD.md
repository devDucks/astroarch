This is the main bag to build an aarch64 ISO using arch linux that will be focused around astronomical software like kstars and indi.


**!!! DRAGONS AHEAD !!!**

**If you are here you likely know what you're going to do, this section is strictly for people who wants to test how to build the .img
 I package from scratch**


The guide is for the raspberry pi aarch64 version of arch linux but it should work with any version.

# How to build the ISO


## Prepare the SD card
Insert the SD card into your PC and check under which device name it presents itself (it may be `/dev/sdX` or `/dev/mmcblkX`), the guide will assume
it's `/dev/mmcblk0`, if your PC mounts the card automatically **you need to unmount it before proceeding**

The next commands assume that after `type X` an `enter` is given to confirm the command

- Run fdisk typing `sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0`
- type `o` this will wipe all the existing partitions from the card
- type `n` then `p` then `1`, when prompted for the first sector press `enter`, when prompted for the last sector type `+512M` (some guides report `100M` but from
personal experience that is not enough as after all updates the boot partition will be full)
- type `t` and then type `0c` to modify the just created partition to `W95FAT LBA`
- type `n` then `p` and take note of the number under `End` this will be used as starting point for the next partition
- type `n` then `p` then `2`, when prompted for the `First sector` check if the default value is bigger than the number you noted before, if it's bigger confirm
with `enter` otherwise add 1 to the number annotated before and use it in this step
- confirm the `Last sector` with enter
- type `w` to write the changes to the card, this will also exit fdisk.
- type `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1` (/dev/sdX1 for sd like devices)
- type `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2`

At this point the SD card is ready!

## Raspberry Pi 4 C0 (sd issue on boot)
BE AWARE AND READ THIS!
If you have a recent model marked as C0 (look here https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=15422&start=20)
You need to tweak 2 things to be able to boot:
 1) You don't need to do the sed command from the next step and you don't need to add the second entry in `/etc/fstab`
 2) you additionally need to edit `/boot/boot.txt`, edit the two lines starting with `booti` changing `fdt_addr_r` to `fdt_addr`
 3) run `sudo ./mkscr` within the `boot/` folder after 2 otherwise the changes won't be written into the bootloader

## Burn the iso to the SD card

We will proceed with moving the arch iso to the SD card

- `mkdir arch-install && cd arch-install`
- `mkdir boot`
- `mkdir root`
- `wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-aarch64-latest.tar.gz`
- `sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 boot/`
- `sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 root/`
- `bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-aarch64-latest.tar.gz -C root`
- `sudo mv root/boot/* boot`
- `sudo sed -i 's/mmcblk0/mmcblk1/g' root/etc/fstab`
-  edit the file `root/etc/fstab` adding the following line `/dev/mmcblk1p2  /       ext4    defaults        0       0`
- `sudo umount boot/ root/`

Congratz! Your SD card is ready, insert it into your raspberry and boot it!

## First boot

Connect your raspberry pi to your netowork via an ethernet cable, you can ssh into it after the boot using `ssh alarm@IP_OF_YOUR_RASPBERRY` the password will
be `alarm`

You'll be dropped into `alarm` shell and now we can proceed:
- become sudo with `su -` the password is `root`
- type `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devDucks/astroarch/main/astroarch_build.sh > astroarch_build.sh`
- type `bash astroarch_build.sh`

This is the only thing required, the rest of the procedure is fully automated!

## Manual steps to finalize the image
After reboot, few final steps may be made to improve further the final image, mainly:
- Use UUID in `/etc/fstab` so that the image can start with every media attached (SD, USB, HDD, SDD)
  Dump the following table into `/etc/fstab`, to know the partition id simply run `sudo blkid` and look for UUID values
  ```
  # Static information about the filesystems.
  # See fstab(5) for details.

  # <file system> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
  UUID=XXXX-XXXX  /boot   vfat    defaults        0       0
  UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX  / ext4 defaults 0 1
  ```
- Set the theme to dark breeze
- Set a wallpaper
- Edit `/boot/cmdline.txt` replacing the default content with
  ```
  root=UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX rw rootwait console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 fsck.repair=yes plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080@60D
  ```
- start Kstars without acknowledging any message, start ekos simulator, go to the guiding tab and download the most common indexes
- enable the resize script to do its magic on the user's first boot - run `sudo systemctl enable resize_once`
- enable the access point script to do its magic on the user's first boot - run `sudo systemctl enable create_ap`

Now the raspberry can be turned off and the image packaging can start

## Repackaging .img file

Once astroarch has been fully bootstrapped the image can be repackaged to be distributed

Using `pishrink` follow these steps:
- create a .img file of the SD card with `sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=astroarch.img bs=8M status=progress` (if mmcblk0 is not the raspberry SD card, change accordingly)
- `sudo ./pishrink.sh -za astroarch.img astroarch-X.X.X.img.gz`

the gzipped image is ready to be distributed and can be flashed on other media

## Building with an AstroArch script from an existing AstroArch version 
## (according to this description https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_from_existing_Linux)

Copy the AA_build_fromAA.sh and astroarch_build_chroot.sh files from the GitHub site https://github.com/sc74/astroarch/tree/1.10/build-astroarch to your Home directory

Make them executable with the command chown +x followed by the file name. Mount a drive or disk and simply run the command AA_build_fromAA.sh

The script will simply ask you which device you want to install on and the password for astronaut

At the end of the process, you will have a working installation on your device and an image to install on another device

The scripts are easily modifiable to create your own AstroArch. The first script allows you to pass the files needed for the build

The second builds the OS. You can add packages, services, and any other files to customize your setup
